<h1>Customer Data</h1>
<p>Developed a single-page application in React which shows a customer details
portal with the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The portal has a dummy list of customers on the left side and upon clicking a card on the left
    the dummy details of the customer are shown on the right side.
  </li>
  <li>
    As of now the customer list on the left has 100 entries which is coming from an API. The API was generated with the dummy data.
  </li>
  <li>
    The card in the list shows the name of the customer as Card-number and his title as Lorem Ipsum data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Customer details include the card name, title and a 3x3 grid of 9 photos.
  </li>
  <li>
    The selected card on the left is highlighted.
  </li>
  <li>All the pictures in the photo grid should change every 10 seconds. Fetched the photos
from UNSPLASH using it's public API.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: The API limit for images is 50 per hour and as the images will change after every 10 sec,so if the images are not rendered on the site please wait for another hour.</p>

<h1>Technology Used </h1>
<ul>
<li>React</li>
<li>React Redux for state management.(While the site's size did not necessitate it, I opted to include it in anticipation of potential future growth.)</li>
<li>TailwindCSS</li>
</ul>
